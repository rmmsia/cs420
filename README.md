# cs420
This repo contains files associated with assignments I submitted for CS420 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, an introductory artificial intelligence course at Singapore Management University (SMU). As the course goes for breadth rather than depth into any particular domain, the problems this code attempts to solve are quite diverse.

## Libraries
AI-specific
- `pgmpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `nltk`
- `gensim` (Word2Vec)
- `gymnasium`

Miscellaneous
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`


## Problems
All questions that involve writing some kind of implementation were answered using Jupyter Notebooks. Others that required qualitative explanation or quantitative calculation were omitted.


### Assignment 1
`CS420_A1_pgmpy.ipynb` - Bayesian Networks: `pgmpy` was used to construct the Bayesian Network and answer the probability-related questions posed.

`CS420_A1Q4_final.ipynb` - Artificial Neural Networks: `tensorflow` and `keras` were used in an image classification problem

`CS420_A1Q5_final.ipynb` - Convolutional Neural Networks: `tensorflow` and `keras` were also used here

### Assignment 2
`CS420_A2Q4_final.ipynb` - Natural Language Processing: `nltk` and `gensim.models.Word2Vec` were used to parse tweet data and find words that are likely to be associated with others

`CS420_A2Q5_GymRL.ipynb` - Reinforcement Learning: `gymnasium` was used in the training of an RL model to navigate a frozen lake
